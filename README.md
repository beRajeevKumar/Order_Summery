### What I learned

By the end of the project, I learned how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox effectively in my projects. I also learned how to use CSS custom properties to make my code more readable and maintainable. I also learned how to use semantic HTML5 markup to make my code more accessible and SEO-friendly. I also learned how to use responsive design to make my projects look good on all devices.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on responsive design and accessibility in my future projects. I will also focus on learning more about CSS Grid and Flexbox and how to use them effectively in my projects. I will also focus on learning more about CSS animations and transitions and how to use them in my projects.
